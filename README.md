This is an improvement on the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm where, a text file is open and read into a variable then the contents of the variable is looped over and changed based on the key the user entered
then the encrypted contents is written in another file. the decryption script is also here which take the encrypted file and decrypts it based on the same key used in encrypting it.
